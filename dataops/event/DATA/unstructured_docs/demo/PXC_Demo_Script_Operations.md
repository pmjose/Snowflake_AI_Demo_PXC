# PXC Operations Demo Script (Network & Delivery)

Use the Operations Agent tools to correlate network health with customer impact for PXC.

**Suggested flow**
1) **Outages & Reliability**: Ask for current incident volume, affected regions, and restoration progress.  
2) **Capacity & Performance**: Check utilisation on key hubs (London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow) and latency/jitter improvements from upgrades.  
3) **Install/Lead Times**: Review install lead time by region and SLA adherence for SME/public sector circuits.  
4) **Customer Signals**: Combine sentiment, NPS, and churn risk by region and product tier (broadband-only vs bundles).  
5) **Actions**: Request prioritised remediation steps and customer communications recommendations.
