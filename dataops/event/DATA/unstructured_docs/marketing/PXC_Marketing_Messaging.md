# PXC Marketing Messaging (Demo)

- Brand promise: wholesale full fibre that delivers fast, reliable broadband with choice of ISP partner.  
- Hero offers: broadband-first bundles with partner TV/streaming options, WiFi assurance, and SIM-only mobile add-ons.  
- Proof points: multi-gigabit speeds (up to 5.5Gb) on XGS-PON rollout, WiFi assurance, strong streaming/gaming performance.  
- Customer personas: busy households streaming on many devices, remote workers needing stability, and gamers needing low latency.  
- Channels: digital (paid social/search), TV, retail partners, and direct outbound; highlight partner ISP offers on the PXC footprint.  
- Messaging guardrails: emphasize reliability, speed tiers, partner choice, and value versus incumbent networks and regional altnets; avoid overclaiming coverage—anchor to available footprint.  
- KPIs: net adds, bundle penetration, churn, NPS, and uptake of WiFi assurance and multiroom/streaming.
